  <summary><h2>How It Works: The WRITER Agentic Framework</h2></summary>
  <br>

MAESTRO is a sophisticated multi-agent system designed to automate complex research synthesis. Instead of a single AI model, MAESTRO employs a team of specialized AI agents that collaborate to plan, execute, critique, and write research reports.

This methodology ensures a structured, transparent, and rigorous process from the initial question to the final, evidence-based report.

### The Core Agent Team

MAESTRO's capabilities are driven by a team of specialized agents, each with a distinct role:

*   **Agent Controller (The Orchestrator):** Manages the entire mission, delegating tasks to the appropriate agents and ensuring the workflow progresses smoothly from one phase to the next.
*   **Planning Agent (The Strategist):** Takes the user's initial request and transforms it into a structured, hierarchical research plan and a report outline. This creates a clear roadmap for the mission.
*   **Research Agent (The Investigator):** Executes the research plan by gathering information. It uses its tools—the local RAG pipeline and web search—to find relevant evidence and organizes it into structured `ResearchNote` objects.
*   **Reflection Agent (The Critical Reviewer):** This is the key to MAESTRO's analytical depth. The Reflection Agent constantly reviews the work of other agents, identifying knowledge gaps, inconsistencies, or deviations from the plan. Its feedback drives the iterative loops that refine and improve the quality of the research.
*   **Writing Agent (The Synthesizer):** Takes the curated research notes and weaves them into a coherent, well-structured narrative that follows the report outline.

### The Research Process: Iteration and Refinement

The research process is not linear; it's a series of iterative loops designed to simulate critical thinking and ensure a high-quality outcome.

1.  **The Research-Reflection Loop:**
    The `Research Agent` doesn't just gather information in one pass. After an initial round of research, the `Reflection Agent` steps in to critique the findings. It asks questions like:
    *   *Are there gaps in the evidence?*
    *   *Do sources contradict each other?*
    *   *Have new, unexpected themes emerged?*
    Based on this critique, the `Reflection Agent` can recommend new research tasks or even prompt the `Planning Agent` to revise the entire plan. This loop continues until the evidence is comprehensive and robust. The number of iterations is dynamic and depends on the complexity of the topic.

2.  **The Writing-Reflection Loop:**
    Drafting is also an iterative process. Once the `Writing Agent` produces a section of the report, the `Reflection Agent` reviews it for:
    *   **Clarity and Coherence:** Is the argument easy to follow?
    *   **Logical Flow:** Are the ideas connected logically?
    *   **Fidelity to Sources:** Does the writing accurately represent the evidence in the `ResearchNote`s?
    The `Writing Agent` then revises the draft based on this feedback. This loop repeats until the writing meets the required standard of quality and accuracy.

This structured, reflective, and iterative process allows MAESTRO to move beyond simple information aggregation and produce sophisticated, reliable, and auditable research syntheses.

## Getting Started

MAESTRO is designed to be run as a containerized application using Docker.

### Prerequisites
*   **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
*   **Git** for cloning the repository
*   **NVIDIA GPU** (recommended for optimal performance)
*   **Disk Space**: ~5GB for AI models (downloaded automatically on first run)

### Installation

#### Linux/macOS
1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/maestro.git
    cd maestro
    ```

2.  **Configure Your Environment**
    Run the interactive setup script for a guided configuration:
    ```bash
    ./setup-env.sh
    ```
    This will help you set up network settings, API keys, and other essential parameters by creating a `.env` file for you.

3.  **Build and Run**
    Use Docker Compose to build the images and start the services in the background.
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build -d
    ```

#### Windows
1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```powershell
    git clone https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/maestro.git
    cd maestro
    ```

2.  **Configure Your Environment**
    Run the interactive setup script for a guided configuration:
    ```powershell
    # Using PowerShell (recommended)
    .\setup-env.ps1
    
    # Or using Command Prompt
    setup-env.bat
    ```
    This will help you set up network settings, API keys, and other essential parameters by creating a `.env` file for you.

3.  **Build and Run**
    Use Docker Compose to build the images and start the services in the background.
    ```powershell
    docker compose up --build -d
    ```

#### Access MAESTRO
Once the containers are running, access the web interface at the address you configured (e.g., `http://localhost:3030`). The first-time login credentials are `admin` / `adminpass123`. It is highly recommended that you change this password immediately.

> **Windows Users**: For detailed Windows setup instructions, troubleshooting, and CLI usage, see [WINDOWS_SETUP.md](./WINDOWS_SETUP.md).

## Technical Overview

MAESTRO is built on a modern, decoupled architecture:

*   **Backend**: A robust API built with **FastAPI** that handles user authentication, mission control, agentic logic, and the RAG pipeline.
*   **Frontend**: A dynamic and responsive single-page application built with **React**, **Vite**, and **TypeScript**, using **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
*   **Real-time Communication**: **WebSockets** stream live updates, logs, and status changes from the backend to the frontend.
*   **Database**: **SQLAlchemy** and **SQLite** are used for database management.
*   **Containerization**: **Docker Compose** orchestrates the multi-service application for reliable deployment.

### Fully Self-Hosted Operation

MAESTRO can be configured for a completely self-hosted environment. It supports local, OpenAI-compatible API models, allowing you to run your own LLMs. For web searches, it integrates with **SearXNG**, a private and hackable metasearch engine, ensuring that your entire research workflow can remain on your own hardware.

For advanced users and administrators, a powerful **Command Line Interface (CLI)** is available for bulk document ingestion, user management, and other administrative tasks.

#### CLI Usage

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./maestro-cli.sh help
./maestro-cli.sh create-user researcher mypass123
./maestro-cli.sh ingest researcher ./pdfs
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Using PowerShell (recommended)
.\maestro-cli.ps1 help
.\maestro-cli.ps1 create-user researcher mypass123
.\maestro-cli.ps1 ingest researcher ./pdfs

# Or using Command Prompt
maestro-cli.bat help
maestro-cli.bat create-user researcher mypass123
maestro-cli.bat ingest researcher ./pdfs
```
